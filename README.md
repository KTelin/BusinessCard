Peer Assessment

I was able to successfully open your code. The background was crimson with grey text boxes. At first glance, you appear to have all of the required features and windows. 
You used a tab system to display two different windows. I was able to view the “Contact Info” tab and the “Portfolio” tab. The first window included your name, contact information, and major. In the second window, I was able to see your brief “portfolio” description with more detailed information.
I was able to navigate between the “Contact Info” and the “Portfolio” tab using the tab coding system. It was easy to use the button bar at the bottom to move between the two pages. 
When I tested the app, the code ran successfully, and I was able to view both windows and all of the information. However, I ran the app in the iPhone 5s emulator, and I was not able to view all of your contact information. The bottom grey view that contained your contact information was not fully visible, your email address was cut off. 

Over all, the app ran well, met all of the requirements and looked good.
